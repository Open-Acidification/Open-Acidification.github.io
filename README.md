## Welcome to the Open Acidification Project

As mankind adds substantial additional carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) to the atmosphere, as much as one third of that CO<sub>2</sub> is absorbed is absorbed by the ocean.
This CO<sub>2</sub> reacts with water to create carbonic acid, and afterwards further products, which makes the ocean water more acidic.
This process is known as ocean acidification.
Over the next century ocean water is predicted to become 2.5 times more acidic.
It is imperative that we understand how ocean acidification will impact marine organisms and ecosystems.
Because the oceans contain over 99% of the habitable space on earth, and much of the planet's biodiversity this will be a massive undertaking.
Unfortunately, the equipment needed to perform ocean acidification research is expensive, restricting this work to a relatively few well-funded labs.
***The goal of the Open Acidification Project is to create inexpensive open-source tools to conduct ocean acidification research and ultimately greatly increase the amount of quality ocean acidification research that can be accomplished.***

### Recent News

* Check out this video from University of Alaska Southeast highlighting some research that is being done with the Open Acidification pH-Stat units (Tank Controllers). Nice to see these things out in the wild... <https://fb.watch/26HQgnsdgC/>

### Projects

The two main projects are a **Tank Controller** (aka a _phStat_ unit) and an **Alkalinity Titrator**.
Each project has a few supporting projects.

#### Tank Controller

Aquarium control unit for regulate tank pH through CO<sub>2</sub> addition and temperature.

Software:

* [Controller Code](https://github.com/Open-Acidification/TankController) - The arduino code for the tank controller unit (soon will be replaced by the Controller Library)
* [Controller Library](https://github.com/Open-Acidification/TankControllerLib) - The arduino code for the tank controller library
* [Controller Manager](https://github.com/Open-Acidification/TankControllerManager) - Software for the Tank Controller centralized manager which interfaces with the individual units

Hardware:

* [KiCad](https://github.com/Open-Acidification/TankController-KiCad) - KiCad files for PCB design for Open Acidification pH-stat unit
* [Housing](https://github.com/Open-Acidification/TankController-Housing) - 3D models to print housing for pH-stat unit

#### Alkalinity Titrator

An apparatus to determine total alkalinity in sea water using an open-cell titration.

* [Source Code](https://github.com/Open-Acidification/AlkalinityTitrator)
* [KiCad](https://github.com/Open-Acidification/AlkalinityTitrator-KiCad) - KiCad files for PCB design

#### Other Projects

### Contributions

The initial source code and hardware was created by [Kirt Onthank](https://github.com/KirtOnthank).
Since then others have contributed to the project, here are a few highlights from recent student lead efforts.

#### Student Projects

* The Tank Controller's micro controller was updated to support API calls by [Matthew Ma](https://github.com/PlasmaIntec).
* The Tank Controller's server was initial creation was done by [Cameron Bierwagen](https://github.com/3dCameron).
* The Alkalinity Titrator's initial source code was developed by [Kaden Sukachevin](https://github.com/kadensu).
