## The Open Acidification Tank Controller Manager

The Open Acidification Tank Controller Manager, or TCM, is a web application used to allow remote access to tank controllers currently in use.
This gives anyone with the IP addresses of connected tanks the ability to make inputs to and see outputs from the tank controller as if they had physical access to it.
For this reason, the main interface of the web app is designed to be as visually similar to the physical controller as possible.
