## Solder header pins to LCD module

Solder the 16-pin male header to the LCD module on the opposite face of the module from LCD screen. It often help to stick the header pins into a breadboard and then place the LCD module over the headers on the breadboard.

## Assemble Faceplate

Parts needed:
* 3D printed faceplate
* LCD module
* 2x 6-pin female-male jumper cables
* 4x4 matrix keypad
* Button
* 2x 20cm solid core X gauge wire
* 4x XXX hex head bolts
* 4x XXX bolts
* XXX alan wrench
* XXX socket wrench

### Attaching reset button

Cut two sections of solid core XX gauge wire to 20cm.  Strip the insulation from ~1cm from each end of each wire.

Next, solder one end of each wire to the terminals of the reset button.

Disassemble the button pulling the red button cap from the button pin.  Then, unscrew the nut from the button.

Now, push the reset button through the back face of the faceplate and screw it into the nut until the button assembly is tight against the faceplate.

Finally, reseat the red button cap onto the pin.

### Attach keypad to faceplate

Pull the flex cable through from the back side of the faceplate to take up the clas in the cable with one hand while placing the keypad square (so the bottom edge is parallel with the bottom edge of the faceplate) with the other hand. Once the keypad is placed down on the faceplate, press down firmly on all parts of the keypad to securely adhere the keypad to the faceplate.
