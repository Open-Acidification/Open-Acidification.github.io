## Attaching pH carrier board female header

![Tools needed]()
* 5 position female header for the pH carrier board
* Custom pcb

There are many methods one could use to attach this header. Here we demonstrate how we have done it.
* Fill first through hole with solder (We use a PCB holder or this process)

* Position the five pins of the header along the five through holes in the box labeled "pH carrier1". Pay attention to the header is on the opposite face of the PCB from the Arduino header pins. Once placed press gently against the pin placed in the filled through hole.

* While pressing header pin against filled through hole, heat the other side of the through hole with your soldering iron. Your pin should fall through the hole and become attached to the board.

![heating through hole](/assets/images/heating_through_hole.jpg)

* Now that the first pin is set and the header provisionally attached, you can reheat the pin to melt the solder and reposition the header if alignment needs to be adjusted.

* Finally, solder the remaining pins on the header. This will be the basic process for attaching all other headers to the board, so we will not reiterate the whole process each time.

* 5 position header pin for the keypad

## Reverse the direction of pins on 2 relay module

1. Pull rubber base up and off

  * Tip - cut rubber base so it only is connect to a single pin. Then pull it off.

1. Remove pins using the soldiering iron and pliers

1. Remove soldier from joints

  ![set up to remove soldier]()

  ![joint clear of soldier]()

  You may need to remove soldier from both sides.

  You can check by attempting to push a pin through the joint. If you can push the pin through easily, it has been cleared.

1. Attach new header pins

## Potentiometer

## 3.5 mm jack

## Realtime clock female headers

## LCD Header

## Power screw terminals

## Jumper pins

## AC Power receptacle

## Buck converts

* Break off four male header pins

* Put pins on a bread board, then put buck converter on top

* Soldier pins in place

Long wires on the bottom of the buck convert should be trimmed before soldiering.

Once pins are in place, they can be attached to the PCB.

Note the placement of the 9v and 5v volt buck converters. Must be placed in the correct location

## 2 Relay soldier pins and put on board

## Temperature break out board

* Break jumper
