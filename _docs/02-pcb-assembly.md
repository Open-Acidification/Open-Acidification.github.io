## Tools Required

* Soldiering iron
* Pliers
* Wire cutters
* Soldier sucker
* soldier

![tools layed out]()

## Male Header Pins

![Arduino, 2.5 mm header pins and custom pcb]()

* Arduino Mega
* 2x 2.5 mm 4 header pins
* 1x 2.5 mm 2x18 header pins
* Custom pcb

![Placed header pins on Arduino]()

![Placed PCB on header pins]()

* Soldier pins on PCB

Carefully remove PCB from arduino

## Female Header Pins

![2.5 mm header pins and custom pcb]()

* 5 position header pin for the pH carrier board
* Custom pcb

Many methods to attach, in this demonstration we used ...

Preset some soldier in on hole, then attach header pins ...

Repeat for all the rest...

* 5 position header pin for the keypad

## Reverse the direction of pins on 2 relay module

1. Pull rubber base up and off

  * Tip - cut rubber base so it only is connect to a single pin. Then pull it off.

  ![relay module without rubber base]()

1. Remove pins using the solding iron and pliers

1. Remove soldier from joints

  ![set up to remove soldier]()

  ![joint clear of soldier]()

  You may need to remove soldier from both sides.

  You can check by attempting to push a pin through the joint. If you can push the pin through easily, it has been cleared.

1. Attach new header pins

## Potentiometer

## 3.5 mm jack

## Realtime clock female headers

## LCD Header

## Power screw terminals

## Jumper pins

## AC Power receptacle

## Buck converts

* Break off four male header pins

* Put pins on a bread board, then put buck converter on top

* Soldier pins in place

Long wires on the bottom of the buck convert should be trimmed before soldiering.

Once pins are in place, they can be attached to the PCB.

Note the placement of the 9v and 5v volt buck converters. Must be placed in the correct location

## 2 Relay soldier pins and put on board

## Temperature break out board

* Break jumper
