The two main projects are a **Tank Controller** (aka a _phStat_ unit) and an **Alkalinity Titrator**.
Each project has a few supporting projects.

### Tank Controller

Aquarium control unit for regulate tank pH through CO<sub>2</sub> addition and temperature.

Software:

* [Controller Code](https://github.com/Open-Acidification/TankController) - The arduino code for the tank controller unit (soon will be replaced by the Controller Library)
* [Controller Library](https://github.com/Open-Acidification/TankControllerLib) - The arduino code for the tank controller library
* [Controller Manager](https://github.com/Open-Acidification/TankControllerManager) - Software for the Tank Controller centralized manager which interfaces with the individual units

Hardware:

* [KiCad](https://github.com/Open-Acidification/TankController-KiCad) - KiCad files for PCB design for Open Acidification pH-stat unit
* [Housing](https://github.com/Open-Acidification/TankController-Housing) - 3D models to print housing for pH-stat unit

### Alkalinity Titrator

An apparatus to determine total alkalinity in sea water using an open-cell titration.

* [Source Code](https://github.com/Open-Acidification/AlkalinityTitrator)
* [KiCad](https://github.com/Open-Acidification/AlkalinityTitrator-KiCad) - KiCad files for PCB design

### Other Projects

* [Open Acidification Project](https://github.com/Open-Acidification/Open-Acidification.github.io) - Project documentation of all related projects.

## Contributions

The initial source code and hardware was created by [Kirt Onthank](https://github.com/KirtOnthank).
Since then others have contributed to the project, here are a few highlights from recent student lead efforts.

### Student Projects

* The Tank Controller's micro controller was updated to support API calls by [Matthew Ma](https://github.com/PlasmaIntec) in 2020.
* The Tank Controller's server was initial creation was done by [Cameron Bierwagen](https://github.com/3dCameron) in 2020.
* The Alkalinity Titrator's initial source code was developed by [Kaden Sukachevin](https://github.com/kadensu) in 2020.
