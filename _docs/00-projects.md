The two main projects are a **Tank Controller** (aka a _phStat_ unit) and an **Alkalinity Titrator**.
Each project has a few supporting projects.

### Tank Controller

Aquarium control unit for regulate tank pH (through CO<sub>2</sub> addition) and temperature.

### Tank Controller Manager

Web application interface for remote access to tank controllers connected to the internet.

### Alkalinity Titrator

An apparatus to determine total alkalinity in sea water using an open-cell titration.

## Contributions

The initial source code and hardware was created by [Kirt Onthank](https://github.com/KirtOnthank).
Since then others have contributed to the project, here are a few highlights from recent student lead efforts.

### Student Projects

* The Tank Controller's micro controller was updated to support API calls by [Matthew Ma](https://github.com/PlasmaIntec) in 2020.
* The Tank Controller Manager was initially created by [Cameron Bierwagen](https://github.com/3dCameron) in 2020.
* The Alkalinity Titrator's initial source code was developed by [Kaden Sukachevin](https://github.com/kadensu) in 2020.
* The Tank Controller's micro controller was refactored for testing by [Eliam Calvo](https://github.com/eucalvo) and [Wesley Duerksen](https://github.com/Kavikick) in 2021.
* The Alkalinity Titrator's second round of development was done by [Konrad McClure](https://github.com/KonradMcClure) and [Noah Griffith](https://github.com/Noah-Griffith) in 2021.
* The Tank Controller had support added for remote access via the Tank Controller Manager by [Trevor Natiuk](https://github.com/pianistrevor) in 2022. This was done in collaboration with [Kaelan Willauer](https://github.com/KaelanWillauer) who worked on the Tank Controller Manager and designed its current interface in the same year. 
* The Tank Controller Manager had new features, documentation, and automation added by [Evan Taylor](https://github.com/Suocesky) in 2023.
