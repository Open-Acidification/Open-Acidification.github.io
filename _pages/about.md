## Welcome to the Open Acidification Project

As mankind adds substantial additional carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) to the atmosphere, as much as one third of that CO<sub>2</sub> is absorbed is absorbed by the ocean.
This CO<sub>2</sub> reacts with water to create carbonic acid, and afterwards further products, which makes the ocean water more acidic.
This process is known as ocean acidification.
Over the next century ocean water is predicted to become 2.5 times more acidic.
It is imperative that we understand how ocean acidification will impact marine organisms and ecosystems.
Because the oceans contain over 99% of the habitable space on earth, and much of the planet's biodiversity this will be a massive undertaking.
Unfortunately, the equipment needed to perform ocean acidification research is expensive, restricting this work to a relatively few well-funded labs.
***The goal of the Open Acidification Project is to create inexpensive open-source tools to conduct ocean acidification research and ultimately greatly increase the amount of quality ocean acidification research that can be accomplished.***
